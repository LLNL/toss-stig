# Verify TOSS does not accept IPv4 source-routed packets. Note: If IPv4
# is disabled on the system, this requirement is Not Applicable. Check the value
# of the accept source route variable with the following command: $ sudo sysctl
# net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
# If the returned line does not have a value of "0", a line is not returned, or
# the line is commented out, this is a finding.
