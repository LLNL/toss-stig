# Verify TOSS takes the appropriate action when an audit processing
# failure occurs. Check that TOSS takes the appropriate action when an audit
# processing failure occurs with the following command: $ sudo grep
# disk_error_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf disk_error_action = HALT If the value
# of the "disk_error_action" option is not "SYSLOG", "SINGLE", or "HALT", or the
# line is commented out, ask the system administrator to indicate how the system
# takes appropriate action when an audit process failure occurs. If there is no
# evidence of appropriate action, this is a finding.
