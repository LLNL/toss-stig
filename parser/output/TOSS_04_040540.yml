# Verify TOSS prevents the use of dictionary words for passwords.
# Determine if the field "dictcheck" is set in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf"
# or "/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf" files with the following command: $
# sudo grep -r dictcheck /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d /etc/security/pwquality.conf:dictcheck=1 If the
# "dictcheck" parameter is not set to "1", or is commented out, this is a finding.
