# Verify TOSS does not accept router advertisements on all IPv6
# interfaces by default, unless the system is a router. Note: If IPv6 is disabled
# on the system, this requirement is Not Applicable. Check to see if router
# advertisements are not accepted by default by using the following command: $
# sudo sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra = 0
# If the "accept_ra" value is not "0" and is not documented with the Information
# System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.
