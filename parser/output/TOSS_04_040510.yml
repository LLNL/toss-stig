# actual (secure) Max kernel policy version: 33 If the "Loaded policy name" is not
# set to "targeted", this is a finding. Verify that the /etc/selinux/config file
# is configured to the "SELINUXTYPE" to "targeted": $ sudo grep -i "selinuxtype"
# /etc/selinux/config | grep -v '^#' SELINUXTYPE = targeted If no results are
# returned or "SELINUXTYPE" is not set to "targeted", this is a finding.
