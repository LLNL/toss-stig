# Check that the system locks an account after three unsuccessful logon
# attempts within a period of 15 minutes until released by an administrator with
# the following commands. Note: If a centralized authentication platform (AD, IdM,
# LDAP, etc) is utilized for authentication, then this requirement is not
# applicable, to allow the centralized platform to solely manage user lockout.
# Verify the pam_faillock.so module is present in the "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" and
# " /etc/pam.d/password-auth" files: $ sudo grep pam_faillock.so
# /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/password-auth /etc/pam.d/system-auth:auth
# required pam_faillock.so preauth /etc/pam.d/system-auth:auth required
# pam_faillock.so authfail /etc/pam.d/system-auth:account required pam_faillock.so
# /etc/pam.d/password-auth:auth required pam_faillock.so preauth
# /etc/pam.d/password-auth:auth required pam_faillock.so authfail
# /etc/pam.d/password-auth:account required pam_faillock.so preauth If the
# pam_failllock.so module is not present in the "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" and "
# /etc/pam.d/password-auth" files, this is a finding. Verify the
# "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file is configured to lock an account until
# released by an administrator after three unsuccessful logon attempts: $ sudo
# grep 'unlock_time =' /etc/security/faillock.conf unlock_time = 0 If the
# "unlock_time" option is not set to "0", is missing or commented out, this is a
# finding.
