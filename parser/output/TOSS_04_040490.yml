# Verify the NX (no-execution) bit flag is set on the system. Check

# | grep NX [ 0.000000] NX (Execute Disable) protection: active If "dmesg" does
# not show "NX (Execute Disable) protection" active, check the cpuinfo settings
# with the following command: $ sudo less /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i flags flags :
# fpu vme de pse tsc ms nx rdtscp lm constant_tsc If "flags" does not contain the
# "nx" flag, this is a finding.
