# successful/unsuccessful use of the "chage" command by performing the following
# command to check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules": $ sudo grep
# -w chage /etc/audit/audit.rules -a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/chage -F perm=x
# -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k privileged-chage If the command does not
# return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
