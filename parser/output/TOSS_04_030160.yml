# Verify the audit log directory is owned by user root. First,
# determine where the audit logs are stored with the following command: $ sudo
# grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log
# Using the directory where the audit log file is located, check if the directory
# is owned by user "root" with the following command: $ sudo ls -ld
# /var/log/audit/ drwx------. 2 root root 99 Jul 19 07:32 /var/log/audit/ If the
# audit log directory is not owned by user "root", this is a finding.
