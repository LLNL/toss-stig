# Verify the operating system removes all software components after
# updated versions have been installed. Check if YUM is configured to remove
# unneeded packages with the following command: $ sudo grep -i
# clean_requirements_on_remove /etc/dnf/dnf.conf clean_requirements_on_remove=True
# If "clean_requirements_on_remove" is not set to either "1", "True", or "yes",
# commented out, or is missing from "/etc/dnf/dnf.conf", this is a finding.
