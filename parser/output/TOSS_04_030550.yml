# Verify that the files in directory "/etc/audit/rules.d/" and
# "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" file have a mode of "0640" or less permissive by using
# the following commands: $ sudo ls -l /etc/audit/rules.d -rw-r----- 1 root root
# 1280 Feb 16 17:09 audit.rules $ sudo ls -l /etc/audit/auditd.conf -rw-r----- 1
