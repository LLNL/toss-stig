# If the system is not networked, this requirement is Not Applicable.
# The system clock must be configured to compare the system clock at least every
# 24 hours to the authoritative time source. Check the value of "maxpoll" in the
# "/etc/chrony/chrony.conf" file with the following command: $ sudo grep maxpoll
# /etc/chrony/chrony.conf server tick.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16 If "maxpoll"
# is not set to "16" or does not exist, this is a finding. Verify that the
# "chrony.conf" file is configured to an authoritative DoD time source by running
# the following command: $ grep -i server /etc/chrony.conf server
# tick.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16 server tock.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16
# server ntp2.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16 If the parameter "server" is not
# set, is not set to an authoritative DoD time source, or is commented out, this
# is a finding.


- name: TOSS-04-010180 - TOSS must, for networked systems, compare internal information system clocks at least every 24 hours with a server which is synchronized to one of the redundant United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers, or a time server designated for the appropriate DoD network (NIPRNet/SIPRNet), and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS).
