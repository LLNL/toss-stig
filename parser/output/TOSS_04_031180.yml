# Verify TOSS generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful
# attempts to use the "su" command by performing the following command to check
# the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules": $ sudo grep -w /usr/bin/su
# /etc/audit/audit.rules -a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/su -F perm=x -F
# auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k privileged If the command does not return a
# line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
