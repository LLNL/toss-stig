# Verify the audit logs are owned by user root. First, determine where
# the audit logs are stored with the following command: $ sudo grep -iw log_file
# /etc/audit/auditd.conf log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log Using the location of
# the audit log file, check if the audit log is owned by user "root" with the
# following command: $ sudo ls -l /var/log/audit/audit.log -rw------- 1 root root
# 908084 Jul 19 23:10 /var/log/audit/audit.log If the audit log is not owned by
# user "root", this is a finding.
