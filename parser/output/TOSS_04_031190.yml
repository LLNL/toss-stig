# Verify that an audit event is generated for any
# successful/unsuccessful use of the "umount" command by performing the following
# command to check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules": $ sudo grep
# -w /usr/bin/umount /etc/audit/audit.rules -a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/umount
# -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k privileged If the command does not
# return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
