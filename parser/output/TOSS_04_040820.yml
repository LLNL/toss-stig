# Verify TOSS does not allow interfaces to perform Internet Protocol
# version 4 (IPv4) ICMP redirects by default. Note: If IPv4 is disabled on the
# system, this requirement is Not Applicable. Check the value of the "default
# send_redirects" variables with the following command: $ sudo sysctl
# net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0 If
# the returned line does not have a value of "0", or a line is not returned, this
# is a finding.
