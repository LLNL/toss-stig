# Verify the operating system disables the ability to load the ATM
# protocol kernel module. $ sudo grep -r atm /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep install
# install atm /bin/false If the command does not return any output, or the line is
# commented out, and use of the ATM protocol is not documented with the
# Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this
# is a finding. Verify the operating system disables the ability to use the ATM
# protocol. Check to see if the ATM protocol is disabled with the following
# command: $ sudo grep -r atm /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep "blacklist" blacklist atm
# If the command does not return any output or the output is not "blacklist atm",
# and use of the ATM protocol is not documented with the Information System
# Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.
