# Verify that the TOSS shadow password suite configuration is set to
# encrypt password with a FIPS 140-2-approved cryptographic hashing algorithm.
# Check the hashing algorithm that is being used to hash passwords with the
# following command: $ sudo grep -i crypt /etc/login.defs ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512 If
# "ENCRYPT_METHOD" does not equal SHA512 or greater, this is a finding.
