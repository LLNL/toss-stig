# Verify that TOSS monitors all remote access methods. Check that
# remote access methods are being logged by running the following command: $ sudo
# grep -E '(auth.*|authpriv.*|daemon.*)' /etc/rsyslog.conf
# auth.*;authpriv.*;daemon.* /var/log/secure If any of "auth.*", "authpriv.*" or
# "daemon.*" are not configured to be logged, this is a finding.
