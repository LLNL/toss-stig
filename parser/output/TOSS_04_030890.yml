# Verify TOSS allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least
# one week of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a
# central audit record storage facility. If logs are immediately sent to a central
# audit record storage facility, this requirement is Not Applicable. Determine to
# which partition the audit records are being written with the following command:
# $ sudo grep log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log
# Check the size of the partition to which audit records are written (with the
# example being /var/log/audit/) with the following command: $ sudo df -h
# /var/log/audit/audit.log /dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit If the
# audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for audit records
# (/var/log/audit is a separate partition), determine the amount of space being
# used by other files in the partition with the following command: $ sudo du -sh
# [audit_partition] 1.8G /var/log/audit If the audit record partition is not
# allocated for sufficient storage capacity, this is a finding. Note: The
# partition size needed to capture a week of audit records is based on the
# activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available.
# Typically, 10.0 GB of storage space for audit records should be sufficient.
