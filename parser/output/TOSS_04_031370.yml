# Verify the operating system has the packages required for offloading
# audit logs installed with the following commands: $ sudo yum list installed
# rsyslog rsyslog.x86_64 8.2102.0-5.el8 @AppStream If the "rsyslog" package is not
# installed, ask the administrator to indicate how audit logs are being offloaded
# and what packages are installed to support it. If there is no evidence of audit
# logs being offloaded, this is a finding.
