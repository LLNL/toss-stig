# Verify the operating system, for PKI-based authentication, enforces
# authorized access to the corresponding private key. If the system does not allow
# PKI authentication, this requirement is Not Applicable. Verify the SSH private
# key files have a passphrase. For each private key stored on the system, use the
# following command: $ sudo ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/file If the contents of the
# key are displayed, and use of un-passphrased SSH keys is not documented with the
# Information System Security Officer (ISSO), this is a finding.
