# Verify that SSSD prohibits the use of cached authentications after
# one day. Note: If smart card authentication is not being used on the system,
# this item is Not Applicable. Check that SSSD allows cached authentications with
# the following command: $ sudo grep cache_credentials /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
# cache_credentials = true If "cache_credentials" is set to "false" or missing
# from the configuration file, this is not a finding and no further checks are
# required. If "cache_credentials" is set to "true", check that SSSD prohibits the
# use of cached authentications after one day with the following command: $ sudo
# grep offline_credentials_expiration /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
# offline_credentials_expiration = 1 If "offline_credentials_expiration" is not
# set to a value of "1", this is a finding.
