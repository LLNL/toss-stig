# Inspect the firewall configuration and running services to verify it
# is configured to prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols,
# and/or services that are unnecessary or prohibited. Check which services are
# currently active with the following command: $ sudo firewall-cmd
# --list-all-zones custom (active) target: DROP icmp-block-inversion: no
# interfaces: ens33 sources: services: dhcpv6-client dns http https ldaps rpc-bind
# ssh ports: masquerade: no forward-ports: icmp-blocks: rich rules: Ask the System
# Administrator for the site or program Ports, Protocols, and Services Management
# Component Local Service Assessment (PPSM CLSA). Verify the services allowed by
# the firewall match the PPSM CLSA. If there are additional ports, protocols, or
# services that are not in the PPSM CLSA, or there are ports, protocols, or
# services that are prohibited by the PPSM Category Assurance List (CAL), this is
# a finding.
