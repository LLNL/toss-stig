# Inspect the firewall configuration and running services to verify it is
# configured to prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols,
# and/or services that are unnecessary or prohibited.
#
# Check which services are currently active with the following command:
#
#     $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
#     custom (active)
#     target: DROP
#     icmp-block-inversion: no
#     interfaces: ens33
#     sources:
#     services: dhcpv6-client dns http https ldaps rpc-bind ssh
#     ports:
#     masquerade: no
#     forward-ports:
#     icmp-blocks:
#     rich rules:
#
# Ask the System Administrator for the site or program Ports, Protocols,
# and Services Management Component Local Service Assessment (PPSM CLSA).
# Verify the services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM CLSA.
#
# If there are additional ports, protocols, or services that are not in the
# PPSM CLSA, or there are ports, protocols, or services that are prohibited
# by the PPSM Category Assurance List (CAL), this is a finding.
