# Verify the audit system off-loads audit records onto a different
# system or media from the system being audited with the following command: $ sudo
# grep @@ /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf /etc/rsyslog.conf:*.*
# @@[remoteloggingserver]:[port] If a remote server is not configured, or the line
# is commented out, ask the System Administrator to indicate how the audit logs
# are off-loaded to a different system or media. If there is no evidence that the
# audit logs are being off-loaded to another system or media, this is a finding.
