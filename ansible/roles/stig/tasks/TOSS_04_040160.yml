# Verify the operating system disables the ability to load the
# firewire-core kernel module. $ sudo grep -r firewire-core /etc/modprobe.d/* |
# grep install install firewire-core /bin/false If the command does not return any
# output, or the line is commented out, and use of the firewire-core protocol is
# not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an
# operational requirement, this is a finding. Verify the operating system disables
# the ability to use the firewire-core kernel module. Check to see if the
# firewire-core kernel module is disabled with the following command: $ sudo grep
# -r firewire-core /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep "blacklist" blacklist firewire-core If
# the command does not return any output or the output is not "blacklist
# firewire-core", and use of the firewire-core kernel module is not documented
# with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational
# requirement, this is a finding.
