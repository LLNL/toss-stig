# Verify TOSS does not respond to ICMP echoes sent to a broadcast
# address. Note: If IPv4 is disabled on the system, this requirement is Not
# Applicable. Check the value of the "icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts" variable with
# the following command: $ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts
# net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1 If the returned line does not have a
# value of "1", a line is not returned, or the retuned line is commented out, this
# is a finding.
