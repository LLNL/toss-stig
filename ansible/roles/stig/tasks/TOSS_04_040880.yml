# Verify TOSS does not IPv4 ICMP redirect messages. Note: If IPv4 is
# disabled on the system, this requirement is Not Applicable. Check the value of
# the "all send_redirects" variables with the following command: $ sudo sysctl
# net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0 If the
# returned line does not have a value of "0", or a line is not returned, this is a
# finding.
