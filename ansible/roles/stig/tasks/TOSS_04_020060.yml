# Verify that TOSS contains no duplicate User IDs (UIDs) for interactive users.
#
# Check that the operating system contains no duplicate UIDs for interactive
# users with the following command:
#
#     $ sudo awk -F ":" 'list[$3]++{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd
#
# If output is produced, and the accounts listed are interactive user accounts,
# this is a finding.
