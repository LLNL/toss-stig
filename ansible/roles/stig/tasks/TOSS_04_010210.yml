# Verify the operating system routinely checks the baseline configuration for
# unauthorized changes and notifies the system administrator when anomalies in the
# operation of any security functions are discovered.
#
# Check to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:
#
#     $ sudo yum list installed aide
#
# If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks
# are performed on the system.
#
# Check that TOSS routinely executes a file integrity scan for changes to the
# system baseline. The command used in the example will use a daily occurrence.
#
# Check the cron directories for scripts controlling the execution and notification
# of results of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed
# on the system, use the following commands:
#
#     $ sudo ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide
#      -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 29 Nov 22 2015 aide
#
#     $ sudo grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root
#     /etc/crontab: 30 04 * * * root usr/sbin/aide
#     /var/spool/cron/root: 30 04 * * * root usr/sbin/aide
#
#     $ sudo more /etc/cron.daily/aide
#     #!/bin/bash
#     /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity check run" root@sysname.mil
#
# Here the use of /bin/mail is one example of how to notify designated personnel.
# There may be other methods available to a system, such as notifications from an
# external log aggregation service (e.g., SIEM).
#
# If the file integrity application does not exist, or a script file controlling
# the execution of the file integrity application does not exist, or the file
# integrity application does not notify designated personnel of changes, this is
# a finding.
