# Verify remote access from outside the system using SSH prevents users
# from logging on directly as "root." Check that SSH prevents users from logging
# on directly as "root" with the following command: $ sudo grep -i PermitRootLogin
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config PermitRootLogin no If the "PermitRootLogin" keyword is set
# to "yes", is missing, or is commented out, and is not documented with the
# Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this
# is a finding.
