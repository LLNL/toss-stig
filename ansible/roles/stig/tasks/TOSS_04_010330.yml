# Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution
# with the following command: $ sudo grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf hosts: files
# dns If the DNS entry is missing from the host's line in the "/etc/nsswitch.conf"
# file, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty. Verify the "/etc/resolv.conf"
# file is empty with the following command: $ sudo ls -al /etc/resolv.conf
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf If local host authentication
# is being used and the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is not empty, this is a finding.
# If the DNS entry is found on the host's line of the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file,
# verify the operating system is configured to use two or more name servers for
# DNS resolution. Determine the name servers used by the system with the following
# command: $ sudo grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf nameserver 192.168.1.2
# nameserver 192.168.1.3 If less than two lines are returned that are not
# commented out, this is a finding.
