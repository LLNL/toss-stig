# Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution with
# the following command:
#
#     $ sudo grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf
#     hosts: files dns
#
# If the DNS entry is missing from the host's line in the "/etc/nsswitch.conf"
# file, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty.
#
# Verify the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is empty with the following command:
#
#     $ sudo ls -al /etc/resolv.conf
#     -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf
#
# If local host authentication is being used and the "/etc/resolv.conf" file
# is not empty, this is a finding.
#
# If the DNS entry is found on the host's line of the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file,
# verify the operating system is configured to use two or more name servers
# for DNS resolution.
#
# Determine the name servers used by the system with the following command:
#
#     $ sudo grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf
#     nameserver 192.168.1.2
#     nameserver 192.168.1.3
#
# If less than two lines are returned that are not commented out, this is a finding.
