# Verify the operating system disables the ability to load the CAN protocol

# If the command does not return any output, or the line is commented out,

# Verify the operating system disables the ability to use the CAN protocol.
#
# Check to see if the CAN protocol is disabled with the following command:
#
#     $ sudo grep -r can /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep "blacklist"
#     blacklist can
#
# If the command does not return any output or the output is not
# "blacklist can", and use of the CAN protocol is not documented with the

# this is a finding.
