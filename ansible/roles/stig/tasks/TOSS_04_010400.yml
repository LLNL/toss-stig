# Verify the SSH daemon does not allow authentication using known
# host's authentication with the following command: $ sudo grep -i
# IgnoreUserKnownHosts /etc/ssh/sshd_config IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes If the value
# is returned as "no", the returned line is commented out, or no output is
# returned, this is a finding.
