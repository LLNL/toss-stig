# Verify TOSS does not accept router advertisements on all IPv6 interfaces,
# unless the system is a router.
#
# Note: If IPv6 is disabled on the system, this requirement is Not Applicable.
#
# Check to see if router advertisements are not accepted by using the
# following command:
#
#     $ sudo sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra
#     net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 0
#
# If the "accept_ra" value is not "0" and is not documented with the
# Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement,
# this is a finding.
