# Verify the operating system enforces a delay of at least four seconds
# between console logon prompts following a failed logon attempt with the
# following command:
#
#     $ sudo grep -i fail_delay /etc/login.defs
#     FAIL_DELAY 4
#
# If the value of "FAIL_DELAY" is not set to "4" or greater, or the line
# is commented out, this is a finding.
