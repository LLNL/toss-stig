# Verify TOSS displays the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent
# Banner or equivalent US Government Agency Notice and Consent Banner before
# granting access to the system. Check that TOSS displays a banner at the command
# line login screen with the following command: $ sudo cat /etc/issue "You are
# accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for
# USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes any device attached to
# this IS), you consent to the following conditions: -The USG routinely intercepts
# and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited
# to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense,
# personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI)
# investigations. -At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this
# IS. -Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are
# subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or
# used for any USG-authorized purpose. -This IS includes security measures (e.g.,
# authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your
# personal benefit or privacy. -Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not
# constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the
# content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal
# representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their
# assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential.
# See User Agreement for details." If the system has a graphical logon capability
# and does not display a graphical logon banner, this is a finding. If the text in
# the file does not match the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner or
# equivalent US Government Agency Notice and Consent Banner, this is a finding.
