# Verify TOSS displays the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner or
# equivalent US Government Agency Notice and Consent Banner before granting access
# to the system.
#
# Check that TOSS displays a banner at the command line login screen with the
# following command:
#
#     $ sudo cat /etc/issue
#
#     "You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is
#     provided for USG-authorized use only.
#
#      By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent
#      to the following conditions:
#
#     -The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for
#      purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC
#      monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM),
#      law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
#
#     -At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
#
#     -Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject
#      to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used
#      for any USG-authorized purpose.
#
#     -This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls)
#      to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.
#
#     -Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM,
#      LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged
#      communications, or work product, related to personal representation or
#      services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants.
#      Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User
#      Agreement for details."
#
# If the system has a graphical logon capability and does not display a graphical
# logon banner, this is a finding.
# If the text in the file does not match the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and
# Consent Banner or equivalent US Government Agency Notice and Consent Banner,
# this is a finding.
