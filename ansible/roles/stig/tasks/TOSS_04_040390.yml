# Verify the audit system is configured to take an appropriate action
# when the internal event queue is full: $ sudo grep -i overflow_action
# /etc/audit/auditd.conf overflow_action = syslog If the value of the
# "overflow_action" option is not set to "syslog", "single", "halt", or the line
# is commented out, ask the System Administrator to indicate how the audit logs
# are off-loaded to a different system or media. If there is no evidence that the
# transfer of the audit logs being off-loaded to another system or media takes
# appropriate action if the internal event queue becomes full, this is a finding.
