# Verify TOSS prevents unauthorized disclosure or modification of all
# information requiring at-rest protection by using disk encryption.
#
# If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest
# encryption, this requirement is Not Applicable.
#
# Verify all local system partitions are encrypted with the following
# command:
#
#     $ sudo blkid
#     /dev/mapper/rhel-root: UUID="67b7d7fe-de60-6fd0-befb-e6748cf97743" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"
#
# Every persistent disk partition present must be of TYPE "crypto_LUKS."
# If any partitions other than pseudo file systems (such as /proc or /sys)
# are not type "crypto_LUKS", ask the administrator to indicate how the
# partitions are encrypted. If there is no evidence that all local disk
# partitions are encrypted, this is a finding.
