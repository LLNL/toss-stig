# Verify the operating system disables the ability to load the USB
# Storage kernel module. $ sudo grep -r usb-storage /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep
# "install" install usb-storage /bin/false If the command does not return any
# output, or the line is commented out, and use of USB Storage is not documented
# with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational
# requirement, this is a finding. Verify the operating system disables the ability
# to use USB mass storage devices. Check to see if USB mass storage is disabled
# with the following command: $ sudo grep -r usb-storage /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep
# "blacklist" blacklist usb-storage If the command does not return any output or
# the output is not "blacklist usb-storage", and use of USB storage devices is not
# documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational
# requirement, this is a finding.
