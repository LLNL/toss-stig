# Verify the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file is configured to lock
# an account after three unsuccessful logon attempts within 15 minutes: $ sudo
# grep -e "deny =" -e "fail_interval =" /etc/security/faillock.conf deny = 3
# fail_interval = 900 If the "deny" option is set to "0", more than "3", is
# missing, or is commented out, this is a finding. If the "fail_interval" option
# is set to less than "900", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.
# Note: If the System Administrator demonstrates the use of an approved
# centralized account management method that locks an account after three
# unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of 15 minutes, this requirement is
# Not Applicable.
