# Verify that the SA and ISSO (at a minimum) are notified in the event
# of an audit processing failure. Check that TOSS notifies the SA and ISSO (at a
# minimum) in the event of an audit processing failure with the following command:
# $ sudo grep action_mail_acct /etc/audit/auditd.conf action_mail_acct = root If
# the value of the "action_mail_acct" keyword is not set to "root" and/or other
# accounts for security personnel, the "action_mail_acct" keyword is missing, or
# the retuned line is commented out, ask the system administrator to indicate how
# they and the ISSO are notified of an audit process failure. If there is no
# evidence of the proper personnel being notified of an audit processing failure,
# this is a finding.
