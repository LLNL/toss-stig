# Verify TOSS audits the execution of privileged functions. Check if
# TOSS is configured to audit the execution of the "execve" system call, by
# running the following command: $ sudo grep execve /etc/audit/audit.rules -a
# always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k execpriv -a
# always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k execpriv -a
# always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -k execpriv -a
# always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -k execpriv If the
# command does not return all lines, or the lines are commented out, this is a
# finding.
