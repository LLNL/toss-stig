# Verify that an audit event is generated for any
# successful/unsuccessful use of the "rename" command by performing the following
# command to check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules": $ sudo grep
# -w "rename" /etc/audit/audit.rules -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S rename -F
# auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k delete -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S rename -F
# auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k delete If the command does not return a line, or
# the line is commented out, this is a finding.
