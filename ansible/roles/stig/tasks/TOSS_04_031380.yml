# Verify the operating system has the packages required for encrypting
# offloaded audit logs installed with the following commands: $ sudo yum list
# installed rsyslog-gnutls rsyslog-gnutls.x86_64 8.2102.0-5.el8 @AppStream If the
# "rsyslog-gnutls" package is not installed, ask the administrator to indicate how
# audit logs are being encrypted during offloading and what packages are installed
# to support it. If there is no evidence of audit logs being encrypted during
# offloading, this is a finding.
