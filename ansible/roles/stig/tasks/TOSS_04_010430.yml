# Verify TOSS does not allow an unattended or automatic logon to the system
# via a graphical user interface.
#
# Note: This requirement assumes the use of the TOSS default graphical user
# interface, Gnome Shell. If the system does not have any graphical user
# interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.
#
# Check for the value of the "AutomaticLoginEnable" in the
# "/etc/gdm/custom.conf" file with the following command:
#
#     $ sudo grep -i automaticloginenable /etc/gdm/custom.conf
#     AutomaticLoginEnable=false
#
# If the value of "AutomaticLoginEnable" is missing or is not set to "false",
# this is a finding. If it does, this is a finding. Automatic logon as an authorized
# user allows access to any user with physical access to the operating system.
