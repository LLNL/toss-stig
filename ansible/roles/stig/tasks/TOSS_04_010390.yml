# Verify TOSS is not performing packet forwarding unless the system is
# a router. If the system is a router (sometimes called a gateway) this
# requirement is Not Applicable. Note: If either IPv4 or IPv6 is disabled on the
# system, this requirement only applies to the active internet protocol version.
# Check to see if IP forwarding is enabled using the following commands: $ sudo
# sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0 $ sudo sysctl
# net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 0 If IP forwarding
# value is not "0" and is not documented with the Information System Security
# Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.
