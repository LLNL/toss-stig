# Verify the rsyslog service is enabled and active with the following
# commands: $ sudo systemctl is-enabled rsyslog enabled $ sudo systemctl is-active
# rsyslog active If the service is not "enabled" and "active", this is a finding.
# If "rsyslog" is not enabled, ask the System Administrator how system error
# logging is performed on the system. If there is no evidence of system logging
# being performed on the system, this is a finding.
