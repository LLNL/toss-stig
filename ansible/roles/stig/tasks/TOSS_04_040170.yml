# Verify the operating system disables the ability to load the cramfs
# kernel module. $ sudo grep -r cramfs /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep install install
# cramfs /bin/false If the command does not return any output, or the line is
# commented out, and use of the cramfs protocol is not documented with the
# Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this
# is a finding. Verify the operating system disables the ability to use the cramfs
# kernel module. Check to see if the cramfs kernel module is disabled with the
# following command: $ sudo grep -r cramfs /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep "blacklist"
# blacklist cramfs If the command does not return any output or the output is not
# "blacklist cramfs", and use of the cramfs kernel module is not documented with
# the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement,
# this is a finding.
