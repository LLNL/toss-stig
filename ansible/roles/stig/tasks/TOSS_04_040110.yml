# Verify that TOSS enforces 24 hours/1 day as the minimum password
# lifetime for new user accounts. Check for the value of "PASS_MIN_DAYS" in
# "/etc/login.defs" with the following command: $ sudo grep -i pass_min_days
# /etc/login.defs PASS_MIN_DAYS 1 If the "PASS_MIN_DAYS" parameter value is not
# "1" or greater, or is commented out, this is a finding.
