# Verify all network connections associated with SSH traffic are
# automatically terminated at the end of the session or after 10 minutes of
# inactivity, or as long as documented with the Information System Security
# Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement. Check that the
# "ClientAliveInterval" variable is set to a value of "600" or less and that the
# "ClientAliveCountMax" is set to "1" by performing the following command: $ sudo
# grep -i clientalive /etc/ssh/sshd_config ClientAliveInterval 600
# ClientAliveCountMax 1 If "ClientAliveInterval" and "ClientAliveCountMax" do not
# exist, does not have a product value of "600" or less in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config",
# or is commented out, this is a finding.
