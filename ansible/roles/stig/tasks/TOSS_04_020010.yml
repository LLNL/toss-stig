# Verify TOSS limits the number of concurrent sessions to less than or
# equal to 256 for all accounts and/or account types by issuing the following
# command: $ sudo grep -r -s '^[^#].*maxlogins' /etc/security/limits.conf
# /etc/security/limits.d/*.conf * hard maxlogins 256 This can be set as a global
# domain (with the * wildcard) but may be set differently for multiple domains. If
# the "maxlogins" item is missing, commented out, or the value is set greater than
# "256" and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
# as an operational requirement for all domains that have the "maxlogins" item
# assigned, this is a finding.
