# Verify TOSS prevents the installation of patches, service packs,
# device drivers, or operating system components without verification they have
# been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the
# organization. Check that YUM verifies the signature of packages from a
# repository prior to install with the following command: $ sudo egrep
# '^\[.*\]|gpgcheck' /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo
# /etc/yum.repos.d/appstream.repo:[appstream]
# /etc/yum.repos.d/appstream.repo:gpgcheck=1 /etc/yum.repos.d/baseos.repo:[baseos]
# /etc/yum.repos.d/baseos.repo:gpgcheck=1 If "gpgcheck" is not set to "1", or if
# options are missing or commented out, ask the System Administrator how the
# certificates for patches and other operating system components are verified. If
# there is no process to validate certificates that is approved by the
# organization, this is a finding.
