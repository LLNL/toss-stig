# Verify TOSS does not accept IPv6 source-routed packets by default.
# Note: If IPv6 is disabled on the system, this requirement is Not Applicable.
# Check the value of the accept source route variable with the following command:
# $ sudo sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route
# net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0 If the returned line does not have
# a value of "0", a line is not returned, or the line is commented out, this is a
# finding.
